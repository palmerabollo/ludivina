Ludivina - Thermal Printer Bot for Telegram

## How to run it

You need a Telegram bot and its token [provided by BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). This is the only required env var.

```sh
export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=xyz
```

Dependencies are managed with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#osx--linux--bashonwindows-install-instructions). Python 3.10+ is needed.

```sh
poetry install
poetry run python main.py
```

It has been tested with [Adafruit's Tiny Thermal Receipt Printer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2751). The thermal printer should be available at `/dev/serial0`. Otherwise export the `PRINTER_DEVICE` environment variable.
